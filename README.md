> A community version of the rhythm game Cytus.

**Cytoid** is an open-source alternative to the rhythm game [Cytus](https://www.rayark.com/g/cytus/). 

# Backstory

Cytus is argubly one of the best rhythm games on a mobile device. While the game is both visually and audibly impressive, it is a shame that the game does not allow user customization like [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh). Since many years ago, the Cytus community has been constantly finding ways to contribute fanmade content; from [chapter mockups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Gefg5YdYg&t=453s), [charts](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cytus+fanmade) to tools like [Cytunity](http://cytus-fanon.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:JCEXE/List_of_Cytus_simulation_programs:_2017_edition#Cytunity) (a popular chart editor) and [GLCytus](https://github.com/Dewott/GLCytus) (a simulator that looks almost identical to the original game). However, the former ones are often for ornamental purposes only; while the latter ones are, although powerful and can create [amazing results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sopAxd8MZ0), often too advanced for the normal user. There are also ways to mod the game, but those are way too complicated and probably not legal things to do.

With the release of the [sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAStr9pjq_A) around the corner, and the fact that Cytus has not been receiving updates for almost a year now, it feels about time for the community to step up and extend the original gameplay together, by encourging all people to create, share and play original fanmade content. *"But modding the game is illegal!"* That's why I present to you Cytoid, a cross-platform Unity game, offering:

* Fully functional Cytus-like gameplay
* Original visuals and sound fx
* Easy import of custom levels
* A touchscreen-friendly chart editor **(WIP)**

Which means, accordingly:

* (To players) You don't have to sit there and watch fanmade charts; you can now outright play 'em!
* (To developers) No need to worry about copyright issues anymore!
* (To chart makers) Test out your charts on devices to ensure they are feasible!
* (To all) Make your very first chart without getting into unnecessary technical issues! **(WIP)**

## Getting Started (For Players)

Cytoid is a community-driven rhythm game; although it has bundled a [tutorial level](cytoid.io/browse/io.cytoid.glow_dance), it depends on the community - or you - to create and share new levels. [CytoidDB](cytoid.io/browse) is a good place to start if you are finding new levels to play.

If you are a charter, please head to the [wiki](https://github.com/TigerHix/Cytoid/wiki/a.-Creating-a-level) for information on creating a Cytoid level / converting a Cytus custom chart into a Cytoid level.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

This project is developed in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). A rough decision in fact, but comparing to [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) which I used in my previous [Cytus simulator project](https://github.com/TigerHix/Pulmusic), Unity allows me to iterate the development process much faster for [many reasons](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/8133). The downside is Unity does not work great when it comes to version control and team collaboration, but hopefully [Github for Unity](https://unity.github.com/) will make the process less painful.

## Hmm. You reminded me. Where's the source code?

I know, I know! I'm currently clearing up the project, mainly refactoring code, but also to remove free/paid [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/) assets I used as many as possible. (I used them for quickly prototyping at first, but they are... so convenient!)

If you want to join early, let me know!
